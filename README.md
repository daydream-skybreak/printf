# 0x11. C - printf

The printf project is a collaboration project by 
yonas gebreysus and Adonay Yitbarek, students of the ALX Software Engineering Programme in which a function named "_printf" imitates the actual "printf" command located in the stdio.h library. It contains some of the basic features and functions found in the manual 3 of "printf".



_printf() is a function that performs formatted output conversion and prints data. Its prototype is the following:



int _printf(const char *format, ...)
